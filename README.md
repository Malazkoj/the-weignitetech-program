# The We Ignite Tech program

> This page describes the We Ignite Tech program. 

# What is the program about?
The aim of this program is too help new commers with a technical IT background to get closer the norwegian employment market. During the 16 weeks of the program the students will improve both their soft- and technical skills on topics like programming, testing, security as well as team work, working in Norway or software delivery prosesses.
By completing this program our sutdents will get closer potential job positions as a full stack developer in the norwegian market. 

# What will the students learn?
The programm is articulated around three milestones: Fundamentals of programming, Web development and Software delivery. This progression reflects the journey of tech person from understanding what it is to write code to being a full stack developer.  

## Fundamentals of programming
> Mastering web development in a professional context requires good tools and techniques. The students will first get familiar with their _toolbox_ (a set of applications needed for software development). Then they will have to learn the fundamentals of the JavaScript programming language. 
### [Dev environment](https://github.com/WeIgniteTech/the-weignitetech-program/dev-environment) and [Git](https://github.com/WeIgniteTech/the-weignitetech-program/git)
### [JavaScript](https://github.com/WeIgniteTech/the-weignitetech-program/javascript)
### [Design patterns and paradigms of programming in JS](https://github.com/WeIgniteTech/the-weignitetech-program/advanced-javascript)
### [Web Architecture 101](https://github.com/WeIgniteTech/the-weignitetech-program/web-architecture-101)

## Web development
> As a growing full stack developer each student will have to know enough JavaScript so they can start building applications both in the browser and on the server. Students will also learn of web applications' architecture and the web as a platform besides their programming skills.

## Software Delivery
