# The We Ignite Tech program

> This page describes the We Ignite Tech program. 

## Structure
There are three milestones or modules to this program. Each module has at least one topic, but often several topics. Each topic contains at least a `README.md` file (see the `README-Im-a-topic.md`)
The ideal duration for a topic is three hours (a working session). Some complicated topics can be covered over multiple sessions. Some might be shorter than that.
A topic will often include some practical exercises that need to be downloaded or _cloned_ as an independant Git repository by the students. 
__For example:__ the topic `dev-environment` is described [here](/10-fundamentals-of-programming/10-dev-environment/README.md) in a `README.md` file, as every topics. But in this description it links to another _repository_ with the same name [dev-environment](https://github.com/WeIgniteTech/dev-environment), and which contains the practical aspects of this topic (_howTo_ and some _exercises_). This other repository can be downloaded, cloned or forked by the students. 
By having all _practicalities_ or _exercises_ of a given topic in a separated repository we make it possible for the students to __only__ clone the exercises they need for a particular topic.  

## Modules
### Fundamentals of programming
> Mastering web development in a professional context requires good tools and techniques. The students will first get familiar with their _toolbox_ (a set of applications needed for software development). They will then have to learn the fundamentals of the JavaScript programming language. 
* [Dev environment](/10-fundamentals-of-programming/10-dev-environment/README.md) and [Git](/10-fundamentals-of-programming/20-git/README.md)

   The dev environment is a Linux desktop distribution
   
* [JavaScript](/10-fundamentals-of-programming/30-javascript/README.md)
* [Design patterns and paradigms of programming in JS](/10-fundamentals-of-programming/40-advanced-javascript/README.md)
* [Web Architecture 101](/10-fundamentals-of-programming/50-web-architecture-101/README.md)

### Web development
> As a growing full stack developer each student will have to know enough JavaScript so they can start building applications both in the browser and on the server. Students will also learn of web applications' architecture and the web as a platform besides their programming skills.

### Software Delivery

## About
### What is the purpose of this program?
The aim of this program is too help newcomers with a technical IT background to get closer to the norwegian employment market. During the 16 weeks of the program the students will improve both their soft- and technical skills on topics like programming, testing, security as well as team work, working in Norway and software delivery prosesses.
By completing this program our students will get closer to potential job positions as full stack developers in the norwegian market. 

### What will the students learn?
The program is articulated around three milestones: Fundamentals of programming, Web development and Software delivery. This progression reflects the journey of tech person from understanding what it is to write code to being a full stack developer.
