# Dev environment
> The dev environment is a fundamental asset for the programmer. It contributes to the quality of the code (by ensuring its predictability) and gives the programmer the possibility to fully control the build process.    

## Learning goals
This topic will guide you through: 
* understand what a dev environment is
* what a (good) dev environment can help you with
* install and build your own dev environment
* understand the importance of predictability in the build (and run) process
* getting familiar with the terminal and the command line
* getting familiar with the Linux system
 
## Prerequisite to this topic 
> Bring your machine to the course
Install the following software on your machine (you might need to restart your machine if your system requires so): 
* [VirtualBox (5.2.20)](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* [Vagrant (2.2.0)](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

Optional: read this [blog post](https://www.getzephyr.com/insights/benefits-standardized-development-environments-agile-development)

## Content of the session
> The session is approx. 3 hours
> We start first by installing a predefined dev environment (a Lubuntu desktop - a Linux distribution - running in a virtual machine) 
Create a `WIT` folder on your machine and copy the following `Vagrantfile` into the same folder: (TODO: link to a VagrantFile `raw`)
Open a terminal and go to your `WIT` folder where the `Vagrantfile` is now copied
Run `vagrant up`
> Then we explore the newly installed VM together
> Exercises (TODO)
 * create your user
 * setup your GitHub account
 * setup your dotfiles
