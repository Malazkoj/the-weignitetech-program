# Dev environment
> The dev environment is a fundamental asset for the programmer. It contributes to the quality of the code (by ensuring its predictability) and gives the programmer the possibility to fully control the build process.    

## Learning goals
This topic will guide you through: 
* understand what a dev environment is
* what a (good) dev environment can help you with
* install and build your own dev environment
* understand the importance of predictability in the build (and run) process
* getting familiar with the terminal and the command line
* getting familiar with the Linux system
 
## Lectures / Prerequisite to this topic 
> No particular reading or homework for this session. 

The following tasks can be achieved before the session starts 
  * Create a `GitHub` account
  * Install the following software on your machine (you might need to restart your machine if your system requires so): 
    * [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) (version > 5.2.18)
    * [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) (version > 2.1.5)
  * Curious? Read this [blog post](https://www.getzephyr.com/insights/benefits-standardized-development-environments-agile-development)

## Content of the session
> The session is approx. 3 hours. We start first by installing a predefined dev environment (a Linux desktop running in a Virtual Machine). When the dev environment is installed we finalize it and get familiar with it. 

  * Follow the instructions here: [dev environment - HowTo](https://github.com/WeIgniteTech/the-weignitetech-program/blob/master/10-fundamentals-of-programming/10-dev-environment/README.md)

  * After the install is finished, inside the VM (aka `Guest`)
    * Explore the newly installed VM

  * Practice
    * test your GitHub account (setup has been done by following instructions as [mentioned above](https://github.com/WeIgniteTech/the-weignitetech-program/blob/master/10-fundamentals-of-programming/10-dev-environment/README.md))
    * explore file structure

## Homework
> Use your VM at home.

Exercises
  * [Learn the command line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) 
  * Try the man page of some commands, f.ex. `man ls`
