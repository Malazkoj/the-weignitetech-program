# Fundamentals of programming
> Data structures and types, controle structures (conditions, loops, ...) as well as paradigms of programmation are the main concepts one should be aware of as a programmer. But the environment in wich the code is written and the tools we need to achieve software development are also importants assets and should be mastered.    

## Learning goals
* Setting up a dev environment
* Linux basics
* The command line
* Git, GitHub and collaboration work on source code
* Data structures, data types and control structures in JavaScript
* Object Oriented paradigm
* Design Patterns 
* Testing (write code with test in mind / code covered by tests)
