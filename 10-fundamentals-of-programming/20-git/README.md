# Git and GitHub
<!-- Short introduction describing this topic -->
> When we develop software, we create files, add lines of code to the files, remove lines of code from the files, delete files, rename files, rename files... we make changes.
We do this in collaboration with others. Version control system is a tool that helps us track these changes that we introduce to our code.
Git is a distributed version control system. GitHub is a collaboration website that hosts Git repositories.


<!-- why it is relevant for the student(context) -->

Some of the benefits of Git and GitHub are
* Having access to your code from any computer
* Having full overview of the changes you make to your code
* Ability to collaborate with others
* Ability to contribute to open source projects
* It's widely used VCS in most work places
* It can be used as part of your CV, where you can show case what you have worked on

## Learning goals
<!-- Maybe some more text, if not already described above. Or just directly a list of:-->

After this session, you will
* understand why GIT exists
* understand what GitHub is
* be able to create a repository
* be able to use the most basic git commands to work with a project locally
* be able to use the commands needed to push changes to remote repository
* Understand the simplest form of branching
* Know the purpose of the three most common branches and know how to create and navigate them


## Prerequisite to this theme
<!-- > It might be a text with a link to a previous course
Or a list of:
* concepts or techniques to master before this course
* and some more ...
And some link to what might be read before:
* [Lecture 1](https://github.com/WeIgniteTech/the-weignitetech-program/a-topic/lecture-1/page-does-not-exist-yet) -->
It might help to take a look at the following articles and videos.
It's ok if some of the stuff here does not make any sense yet. We will go through it together during the course.
